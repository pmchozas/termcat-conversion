# Mapping-based Conversion Service for Terminological Resources: The TERMCAT Use Case

This is the repository for the Termcat use case of the Automatic Terminology Converters into RDF.

## About the project

Exposing and sharing language resources in the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud has become common practice. However, most of the resources currently available in this cloud have been published within the Linked Data community. Wider adoption of such Linked Data formats and models is still challenging for researchers outside the community, particularly for producers of language resources. In this work, we present our proposal for a Mapping-based Conversion Service, specifically oriented to terminology resources, and intended for non-expert users. After spelling out the steps and technologies involved in the conversion pipeline, we describe the work carried out for the conversion of terminology resources from TERMCAT, making special emphasis on modelling and linking issues. The results of this effort include a mapping repository that gathers the most common types of data included in terminological resources and a terminological knowledge graph that contains a subset of TERMCAT linked glossaries.
